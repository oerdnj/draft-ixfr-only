Internet-Draft                  IXFR-ONLY                      July 2009


1.  Introduction

   For large DNS zones, RFC 1995 [RFC1995] defines Incremental Zone
   Transfer (IXFR), which is an efficient way to transfer changes in
   zones from masters to slaves.

   However, when a slave has multiple masters for a single zone, it is
   possible that not all masters has the same set of serials for that
   zone.  In this case, if a slave attempts an IXFR from a master which
   does not have the serial in use by the slave, the master will fall
   back to a full zone transfer (AXFR).

   For example, master NS1 may have serials 1, 2, and 3 for a zone, and
   master NS2 may have serials 1 and 3.  A slave that is at serial 2
   which sends an IXFR request to NS2 will get a full AXFR of the zone
   at serial 3.  This is because NS2 does not know the zone at serial 2,
   and therefore does not know what the differences are between serial 2
   and serial 3.

   If the slave in this example had known to send the query to NS1, then
   it could have gotten an incremental transfer.  But slaves can only
   know what the latest version of the zone is at a master (this
   information is available via an SOA query).

   The IXFR-ONLY type provides a way for the slaves to ask each master
   to return an error instead of sending the current version of the
   zone.  By using this, a slave can check each master until it finds
   one able to provide IXFR.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Master Side

   A master receiving a DNS message requesting IXFR-ONLY will reply
   exactly as described in RFC 1995 [RFC1995] if it is able to produce
   an IXFR for the serial requested.

   If the master is is not able to reply with an IXFR it MUST NOT reply
   with an AXFR.  Instead, it MUST reply with RCODE CannotIXFR.

3.  Slave Side

   A slave who wishes to use IXFR-ONLY will send a message to one of the
   masters.  The format is exactly the same as for IXFR, except the
   IXFR-ONLY type code is used instead of the IXFR type code.

   If the master replies with IXFR, then the slave is done.

   If the master replies with an RCODE of CannotIXFR, then the slave
   proceeds on to a different master.  In this case the master
   implements IXFR-ONLY, but does not have the serial requested.

   If the master replies with any RCODE other than CannotIXFR or
   NoError, then the slave proceeds on to a different master.  In this
   case the server does not implement IXFR-ONLY.

   If the slave attempts IXFR-ONLY to each master and none reply with an
   incremental transfer, then it should attempt an IXFR as described in
   RFC 1995 [RFC1995] to each of the servers which replied with an RCODE
   other than CannotIXFR or NoError.

   The method described above allows slaves to operate normally to have
   some masters who support IXFR-ONLY, and some who do not.  Slaves MAY
   remember which masters support IXFR-ONLY and query those masters
   first.  However since masters may change software or even run a mix
   of software, slaves MUST attempt to query each master periodically
   when they attempt to get new versions of a zone.

   Implementations SHOULD allow slaves to disable IXFR-ONLY for a given
   master, if this is known in advance.  These masters are treated as if
   they replied with an RCODE other than CannotIXFR or NoError, although
   no query with IXFR-ONLY is actually sent.


4.  Applicability of IXFR-ONLY

   Implementations MUST allow slaves to disable IXFR-ONLY completely.

   Implementations SHOULD allow slaves to disable IXFR-ONLY for a
   specific zone.  This may be useful for small zones, where fallback to
   AXFR is cheap, or in other cases where IXFR-ONLY is causing problems.

   Usage of IXFR-ONLY may cause slaves to prefer particular masters, by
   shifting load to ones that support IXFR-ONLY.  If this a problem,
   then administrators can disable IXFR-ONLY.

   If a slave has a single master for a zone, it SHOULD use IXFR rather
   than IXFR-ONLY.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA allocates the new IXFR-ONLY TYPE, which means "incremental
   transfer only".  IANA allocates the CannotIXFR RCODE, which means
   "Server cannot provide IXFR for zone".


6.  Security Considerations

   IXFR-ONLY may be used by someone to get information about the state
   of masters by providing a quick and efficient way to check which
   versions of a zone each master supports.  Zones should be secured via
   TSIG [RFC2845] prevent unauthorized information exposure.  However,
   even administrators of master servers may not want this information
   given to slaves, in which case they will need to disable IXFR-ONLY.
