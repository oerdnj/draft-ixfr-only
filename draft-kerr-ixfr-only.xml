    <abstract>
      <t>Presents IXFR-ONLY, a way for a DNS slave to prevent a DNS
      master from falling back from IXFR to AXFR.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
<t>
For large DNS zones, <xref target="RFC1995">RFC&nbsp;1995</xref> 
defines Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR), which is an efficient way 
to transfer changes in zones from masters to slaves.
</t>
<t>
However, when a slave has multiple masters for a single zone, it is
possible that not all masters have the same set of serials for that
zone. In this case, if a slave attempts an IXFR from a master which
does not have the serial in use by the slave, the master will fall
back to a full zone transfer (AXFR) when it has a newer version of 
the zone.
</t>
<t>
For example, master NS1 may have serials 1, 2, and 3 for a zone, and
master NS2 may have serials 1 and 3. A slave that is at serial 2
which sends an IXFR request to NS2 will get a full AXFR of the zone at
serial 3. This is because NS2 does not know the zone at serial 2, and
therefore does not know what the differences are between serial 2 and
serial 3.
</t>
<t>
If the slave in this example had known to send the query to NS1, then
it could have gotten an incremental transfer. But slaves can only know
what the latest version of the zone is at a master (this information
is available via an SOA query).
</t>
<t>
The IXFR-ONLY type provides a way for the slaves to ask each master to
return an error instead of sending the current version of the zone. By
using this, a slave can check each master until it finds one able to
provide IXFR.
</t>
      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Master Side">
<t>
A master receiving a DNS message requesting IXFR-ONLY will reply
as described in <xref target="RFC1995">RFC&nbsp;1995</xref> if it is
able to produce an IXFR for the serial requested.
</t>
<t>
If the master is is not able to reply with an IXFR it MUST NOT reply
with an AXFR. Instead, it MUST reply with RCODE CannotIXFR.
</t>
<t>
If the IXFR result is larger than an AXFR, then a master MAY reply
with an AXFR result instead. This is an optimization, and masters will
only do this if they are certain that the reply using AXFR is smaller
than an equivalent IXFR reply.
</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Slave Side">
<t>
A slave who wishes to use IXFR-ONLY will send a message to one of the
masters. The format is exactly the same as for IXFR, except the
IXFR-ONLY type code is used instead of the IXFR type code.
</t>
<t>
If the master replies with IXFR, then the slave is done.
</t>
<t>
If the master replies with an RCODE of CannotIXFR, then the slave
proceeds on to a different master. In this case the master implements
IXFR-ONLY, but does not have the serial requested.
</t>
<t>
If the master replies with any RCODE other than CannotIXFR or NoError,
then the slave proceeds on to a different master. In this case the
server does not implement IXFR-ONLY.
</t>
<t>
If the slave attempts IXFR-ONLY to each master and none reply with an
incremental transfer, then it should attempt an IXFR as described in
<xref target="RFC1995">RFC&nbsp;1995</xref> to each of the servers
which replied with an RCODE other than CannotIXFR or NoError.
</t>
<t>
The method described above allows slaves to operate normally to have
some masters who support IXFR-ONLY, and some who do not. Slaves MAY
remember which masters support IXFR-ONLY and query those masters
first. However since masters may change software or even run a mix of
software, slaves MUST attempt to query each master periodically when
they attempt to get new versions of a zone.
</t>
<t>
Implementations MAY allow slaves to disable IXFR-ONLY for a given
master, if this is known in advance. These masters are treated as if
they replied with an RCODE other than CannotIXFR or NoError, although
no query with IXFR-ONLY is actually sent.
</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Applicability of IXFR-ONLY">
<t>
Implementations SHOULD allow slaves to disable IXFR-ONLY completely.
</t>
<t>
Implementations MAY allow slaves to disable IXFR-ONLY for a
specific zone. This may be useful for small zones, where fallback to
AXFR is cheap, or in other cases where IXFR-ONLY is causing problems.
</t>
<t>
Usage of IXFR-ONLY may cause slaves to prefer particular masters, by
shifting load to ones that support IXFR-ONLY. If this a problem, then
administrators can disable IXFR-ONLY in implementations that allow it.
</t>
<t>
If a slave has a single master for a zone, it SHOULD use IXFR rather
than IXFR-ONLY.
</t>

    <!-- Possibly a 'Contributors' section ... -->

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
<t>
IANA allocates the new IXFR-ONLY TYPE, which means "incremental
transfer only". IANA allocates the CannotIXFR RCODE, which means
"Server cannot provide IXFR for zone".
</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
IXFR-ONLY may be used by someone to get information about the state of
masters by providing a quick and efficient way to check which versions
of a zone each master supports. Zones should be secured via 
<xref target="RFC2845">TSIG</xref> prevent unauthorized information
exposure. However, even administrators of master servers may not want
this information given to slaves, in which case they will need to
disable IXFR-ONLY.
